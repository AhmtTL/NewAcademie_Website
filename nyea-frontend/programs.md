NASA Space Training 2025

"The Dream is Alive"
Refers to astronaut John Young's belief that space travel was still possible after successfully landing the Columbia orbiter in southern California, marking a new era of space travel. The Space Shuttle Program played a significant role in developing the International Space Station and increasing access to space. The New York Empire Academy is investigating the possibility of life on Mars through NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which is seeking signs of past or current microbial life on the planet. This requires understanding the planet's geologic and climate history.

What are we going to accomplish in the NASA Camp?
The Camp in the Kennedy Space Center, located in Orlando, will be a journey for future young astronauts! The activities such as flying in a frictionless environment as if you are in space, to space engineering designs will be an extraordinary experience for our participants! Activities with their details are as follows:

ASTRONAUT TRAINING WORKSHOP (ATW)
Launch operations, Mars operations, and microgravity operations are the three areas in which campers can train. Campers will be given a job in Mission Control or the Orion spacecraft during the Launch training. The teams’ capacity to launch and dock their spacecraft while managing one or more emergencies will determine how well they perform. Campers will rotate between landing, driving, and/or walking on Mars utilizing virtual reality equipment in the Mars Surface Exploration training facility. Campers will strap into our unique microgravity chairs for Microgravity Operations training to see what it’s like to work in a frictionless environment!

MARS BASE 1
On the Red Planet, campers will engage in a range of activities. Following the crash landing of an unmanned supply ship, campers cooperate in the Base Operations Center to maintain the health and safety of the Mars Base. They program and control a horde of robots in the engineering lab to clean debris from solar panels so that the base can be powered. Additionally, campers learn how to produce veggies indoors in our Botany Lab.

TO THE MOON AND BEYOND
Additionally, campers travel into the vacuum of outer space. Buses from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex will pick them up, and they’ll travel to the Apollo/Saturn V Center for the facility’s exhibits and activities. While studying about the past and future of exploring other planetary bodies in our solar system, students gaze in amazement at the enormous Saturn V Moon rocket. Additionally, while learning about this active launch site, campers may observe the enormous Vehicle Assembly Building from the bus window on the way to the attraction.

LOW-EARTH ORBIT
Campers learn about the numerous programs that NASA and its collaborators have developed to enable people to live and work in the space that is closest to Earth throughout the course of the program. Campers take part in escorted interactive explorations, scavenger hunts, STEM challenges, and immersive simulations to better appreciate NASA’s continuous dedication to environmental stewardship and global technology. The Rocket Garden, Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame®, Journey to Mars: Explorers Wanted, NASA Now, Shuttle Launch Experience®, and, weather permitting, the Space Shuttle Atlantis® exhibits are just a few of the activity areas. The brand-new Gateway: The Deep Space Launch Complex® is also explored by campers.

ENGINEERING DESIGN CHALLENGES
Without cutting-edge engineering, NASA would not be what it is today. Therefore, throughout the week, campers will take part in a variety of practical engineering design challenges suited to their grade level. The Engineering Design Process (ask, imagine, plan, construct, test, improve) is used by campers to address a variety of problems after they have learned some fundamental engineering concepts. Particular difficulties vary from year to year and from team to team.

STEM CHALLENGES
While performing various projects, campers use cooperation and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) abilities to think critically, communicate, and solve problems. All students discover that STEM subjects can be enjoyable and rewarding. Also different from year to year and from team to team are the specific STEM challenges.
